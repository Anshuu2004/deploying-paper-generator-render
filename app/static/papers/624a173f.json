      "options": [],
      "marks": 4,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "Dispersion is the phenomenon of splitting white light into its constituent seven colours (VIBGYOR) upon passing through a transparent medium like a glass prism.\nCause of Dispersion:\nWhite light is composed of different wavelengths (colors). The refractive index (n) of the prism glass is different for different wavelengths (colors). Since the speed of light varies with the refractive index, different colors travel at different speeds inside the glass. Consequently, they bend (refract) through different angles. Violet light bends the most (highest refractive index/shortest wavelength), and red light bends the least (lowest refractive index/longest wavelength), causing the separation.",

      "marks": 5,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Mechanism:\n1. Inhalation: The diaphragm flattens, and rib cage moves up and out. This increases the volume of the chest cavity, decreasing the pressure, forcing air into the lungs.\n2. Exchange at Alveoli: Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the surrounding blood capillaries, which have a lower concentration of O₂. Simultaneously, CO₂ from the blood (high concentration) diffuses into the alveoli (low concentration).\n3. Transportation: Oxygenated blood is transported to body tissues.\n4. Exhalation: Diaphragm relaxes and returns to its dome shape, rib cage moves down and in. This decreases the volume of the chest cavity, increasing pressure, forcing CO₂ rich air out.\n(Diagram must include: Nasal passage, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi, Bronchioles, Lungs, Alveoli, Diaphragm).",

      "options": [],
      "marks": 5,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "Principle: An electric motor works on the principle that when a current-carrying conductor is placed perpendicularly in a magnetic field, it experiences a force that causes it to move.\n(Diagram must include: Strong Magnetic Poles, Armature Coil, Axle, Split Ring Commutator, Brushes, Battery).\nWorking: When current flows through the coil, two sides (AB and CD) experience equal and opposite forces (determined by Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule). These forces form a couple, causing the coil to rotate continuously.\nRole of Commutator: The split ring acts as a commutator, reversing the direction of the current in the coil after every half rotation. This ensures that the force acting on the coil sides always pushes them in the same direction (e.g., AB always pushed down, CD always pushed up), ensuring continuous rotation.",

Why does asexual reproduction, like fragmentation, produce very little variation compared to sexual reproduction?\n2.

      "options": [],
      "marks": 4,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "1. Asexual reproduction typically involves only one parent and relies primarily on mitotic divisions. The offspring are genetically identical clones (except for minor mutations). Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes from two parents and features genetic recombination (crossing over) and independent assortment during meiosis, leading to high variation.\n2. If the environment changes suddenly (e.g., new predator, disease outbreak, climate change), all identical individuals may be equally susceptible, potentially leading to the extinction of the entire population.\n3. In both males (sperm) and females (ova), variation is generated through Meiosis (reduction division), which shuffles parental genes. However, males produce millions of gametes continuously, while females typically produce only one mature ovum per month, meaning the potential for new gametic combinations is exercised differently over time.",
      "explanation": "Focuses on the core concept of variation, its source (meiosis), and its adaptive significance.",

      "question_text": "Variation is crucial for the survival of a species. Consider two modes of reproduction: (A) Asexual Reproduction (e.g., fragmentation in Spirogyra) and (B) Sexual Reproduction.\n1. Why does asexual reproduction, like fragmentation, produce very little variation compared to sexual reproduction?\n2. State one specific disadvantage that lack of variation (high similarity) poses to a population of organisms in a changing environment.\n3. How is the process of generating variation different in human males and females during gamete formation?"
