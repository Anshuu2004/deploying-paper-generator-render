For the first 15 minutes, the car covered 20 km, and for the remaining time, it covered 40 km.\n\n(i) What was the total distance covered in meters?\n(ii) Calculate the average speed of the car in km/h.\n(iii) Was the car moving with uniform motion throughout the journey? Justify your answer."

      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "answer": "(i) Cell A is a Skeletal Muscle Fibre (Striated Muscle). Primary location: Attached to bones, responsible for voluntary body movements.\n(ii) Cell B is a Neuron (Nerve Cell). The axon’s function is to transmit the nerve impulse away from the cell body towards the next neuron or muscle.\n(iii) Cell A (Muscle cell) is responsible for generating force and causing mechanical movement/contraction, while Cell B (Nerve cell) is responsible for rapid communication and transmission of electrical signals (impulses).",
      "explanation": "Tests the identification and basic function recall of two major animal tissues (Muscular and Nervous).",
