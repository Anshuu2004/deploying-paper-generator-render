      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Inherited Traits: These are characteristics passed down from parents to offspring through genes (DNA). They cause changes in the germ cells (sex cells) and are therefore heritable.\nExample: Eye colour, blood group, attached earlobes.\n\nAcquired Traits: These are characteristics developed during an individual's lifetime due to environmental influences, lifestyle, or practice. They do not cause changes in the germ cells and are not passed on to the next generation.\nExample: Learning to swim, damaged finger due to injury, gaining muscle mass through exercise.",

      "question": "What is the role of decomposers in an ecosystem? Why is the maintenance of the ozone layer crucial for the survival of life on Earth?",
      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Role of Decomposers: Decomposers (like bacteria and fungi) break down complex organic matter (dead plants, animals, and waste products) into simple inorganic substances that return to the soil. This process replenishes nutrients necessary for producers (plants) and ensures the cycling of matter in the ecosystem.\n\nCruciality of Ozone Layer: The ozone layer absorbs harmful high-energy Ultraviolet (UV) radiation coming from the sun. Exposure to UV radiation causes skin cancer, cataracts, damage to the immune system in humans, and harmful effects on crop yield and aquatic life. Thus, the ozone layer acts as a protective shield.",
