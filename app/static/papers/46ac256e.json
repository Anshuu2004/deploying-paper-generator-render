      "marks": 1,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "For a virtual and erect image, magnification (m) must be positive. Since the image formed by a convex mirror is always diminished, the magnitude of m must be less than 1. Thus, m must be positive and $m < 1$, making +0.5 the only possible value.",
