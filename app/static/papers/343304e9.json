      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In a parallel combination, the equivalent resistance is given by 1/Req = 1/R1 + 1/R2. This calculation always results in an equivalent resistance that is less than the value of the smallest resistor in the combination.",

      ],
      "marks": 1,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "For a real image in a concave mirror, moving the screen closer means the image distance is decreasing. This happens when the object moves away from the mirror (towards C or beyond). Since the image is currently real and decreasing in size as the image distance decreases, the object must be between F and C (Image forms beyond C, magnified). Moving the screen closer corresponds to moving the object away from the mirror, resulting in a smaller image.",

      "marks": 2,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Receptors are structures (like specialized cells or sense organs) that detect the stimulus (change in environment) and convert it into a nerve impulse. Effectors are muscles or glands that receive the instruction from the central nervous system (via motor nerves) and carry out the appropriate response.",

      "question": "Explain why only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the next trophic level in a food chain.",
      "marks": 2,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "The energy transfer is limited to 10% because the remaining 90% of the energy is lost to the environment. This loss occurs primarily through metabolic processes of the organism at that level, such as respiration, digestion, movement, and heat loss to maintain body temperature. This makes food chains typically short (3-4 steps).",
      "explanation": "This requires applying the concept of the 10% law and providing the reasons for the energy dissipation, which links biology and environmental science concepts.",

      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Electron Dot Structure: (The structure must show Carbon sharing 4 electrons with 4 Hydrogen atoms, resulting in 4 covalent bonds.) \nType of Bonding: Methane exhibits Covalent Bonding. This type of bonding is formed by the mutual sharing of valence electrons between the atoms (Carbon and Hydrogen) so that both achieve the stable noble gas configuration.",
      "explanation": "This combines a drawing skill (electron dot structure for a simple hydrocarbon) with the theoretical explanation of covalent bonding, a key concept in Carbon compounds.",

      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Myopia (Nearsightedness) is the eye defect where a person can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly. \nPossible Causes: 1. Excessive curvature of the eye lens. 2. Elongation of the eyeball. \nCorrection: It is corrected by using a concave lens (or diverging lens) of appropriate power. The concave lens diverges the incoming light rays slightly before they reach the eye lens, ensuring the image is formed correctly on the retina.",
      "explanation": "This comprehensive question requires defining the defect, listing its causes (3 marks requires more than just the definition), and specifying the corrective measure and lens type.",
