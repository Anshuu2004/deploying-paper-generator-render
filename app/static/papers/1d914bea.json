Catenation: The unique ability of carbon atoms to link with other carbon atoms to form long chains, branched chains, or closed rings. This forms stable C-C bonds, allowing for the creation of vast molecular diversity.\n2.

Current is supplied to the coil (ABCD) via the commutator and brushes.\n2. Since the current direction in arm AB is opposite to that in arm CD, the forces acting on these arms are opposite (determined by Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule).\n3. The forces produce a torque, causing the coil to rotate.\n4. The split ring (commutator) reverses the direction of the current in the coil every half rotation, ensuring that the force applied is always in the same rotational direction, thus maintaining continuous rotation.\n(A labeled diagram showing Magnet, Armature Coil, Split Rings/Commutator, and Brushes is required.)",

The explant is placed on a nutrient medium containing hormones. The cells divide rapidly to form an undifferentiated mass called a callus. The callus is then transferred to another medium containing growth hormones that induce the differentiation of roots and shoots. Finally, the small plantlets are transferred to soil.",
