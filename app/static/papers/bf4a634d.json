Assuming the exterior angle is ∀PRS = 115°, and we need to find the remote interior angles (P and Q).\nIf ∀PRS = 115°, then ∀PRQ = 180° - 115° = 65°. (The 60° given in the question for ∀PRQ is ignored as it contradicts the linear pair property based on the exterior angle).\nBy Exterior Angle Property: ∀PRS = ∀P + ∀Q.\nWe assume P = ∀QPR and Q = ∀PQR. We need Q or P to solve this. Since Q is not given, let's use the Exterior Angle Property assuming Q = 60° (interpreting the given ∀PRQ = 60° as an error for ∀PQR = 60°, which is standard geometry problem format).\nAssuming ∀PQR = 60° and Exterior Angle ∀PRS = 115°:\n∀QPR + ∀PQR = ∀PRS ⇒ ∀QPR + 60° = 115° ⇒ ∀QPR = 115° - 60° = 55°.\n(Note: The question is slightly flawed by giving two conflicting angle values for R, but solving using the Exterior Angle Theorem assumption yields 55°, which is the expected level solution).",
