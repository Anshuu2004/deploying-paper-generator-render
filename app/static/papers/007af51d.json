      "marks": 5,

      "answer": "The two main mechanisms are:\n1. **Catenation:** Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other carbon atoms, resulting in long chains, branched chains, or ring structures. Carbon-Carbon bonds are very strong and stable, allowing for the formation of extremely large molecules.\n2. **Tetravalency:** Carbon has four valence electrons, meaning it requires four electrons to achieve a stable noble gas configuration. It forms four covalent bonds with other atoms (including C, H, O, N, S, Cl, etc.) simultaneously. This ability to bond with multiple elements and form four stable bonds contributes immensely to the diversity of carbon compounds.",

      "marks": 5,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "Principle: An electric motor works on the principle that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a force (Fleming's Left-Hand Rule).\n\nFunction of Split Ring Commutator: The split ring commutator (or rectifier) is essential for a DC motor. Its function is to reverse the direction of current flowing through the armature coil every half rotation. This reversal ensures that the force acting on the two sides of the coil always continues to rotate the coil in the same direction, thereby maintaining continuous rotation.",

Therefore, carbon cannot reduce the oxides or chlorides of these metals to the free metal state.\n2. The metal 'M' (a cation, M+) will be deposited at the Cathode (the negative electrode).

      "answer": "1. Deforestation leads to increased surface runoff and decreased infiltration of water into the ground. Trees usually bind the soil and allow slow release of groundwater. Lack of trees causes rapid runoff, often leading to flash flooding (initially) but less sustained base flow, contributing to eventual scarcity downstream.\n2. Dams prevent the natural flow of nutrient-rich sediment (silt) downriver, which is essential for replenishing the fertility of the downstream floodplain and topsoil. The trapped silt causes the soil downstream to become less fertile over time.\n3.
