Since $G$ and $M$ (mass of Earth) are constant, $g$ is inversely proportional to $R^2$. \n1. The Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator (oblate spheroid).\n2. Consequently, the radius of the Earth ($R_e$) at the equator is greater than the radius of the Earth ($R_p$) at the poles ($R_e > R_p$).\n3.

      "answer": "The Water Cycle (Hydrologic Cycle) is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves several processes:\n1. Evaporation/Transpiration: Water turns into vapor and rises into the atmosphere.\n2. Condensation: Water vapor rises and cools down, forming tiny water droplets that aggregate to form clouds.\n3. Precipitation: The water droplets become too heavy and fall back to the Earth's surface as rain, snow, or hail.\n4. Runoff/Infiltration: Water flows across the land or seeps into the ground.\n\nRole of Condensation: Condensation is essential because it converts the gaseous water vapor back into liquid form (droplets) in the upper atmosphere, forming clouds. Without condensation, rain formation would not occur.\nRole of Precipitation: Precipitation returns the water stored in the atmosphere back to the lithosphere and hydrosphere, recharging groundwater, rivers, and oceans, thereby completing the cycle.",

Consider an object of mass $m$ with initial velocity $u$. A force $F$ is applied for time $t$, resulting in final velocity $v$.\n2. Initial Momentum ($P_1$) = $mu$.\n3. Final Momentum ($P_2$) = $mv$.\n4. Change in Momentum ($\\Delta P$) = $P_2 - P_1 = mv - mu = m(v - u)$.\n5. Rate of change of momentum = $\\Delta P / t = m(v - u) / t$.\n6. According to the Second Law, $F \\propto m(v - u) / t$.\n7. Since acceleration $a = (v - u) / t$, we substitute this into the proportion:\n$F \\propto ma$.\n8.

      "question_text": "Read the following passage and answer the questions:\n\nOrganisms are grouped based on evolutionary relationship and organization complexity. The Kingdom Monera includes prokaryotic organisms (lacking a defined nucleus) like bacteria, which show tremendous diversity in nutrition (autotrophic or heterotrophic). Protista, however, includes single-celled eukaryotic organisms. These may have structures like cilia or flagella for movement. Fungi are multicellular eukaryotes but are heterotrophic and have cell walls made of chitin, distinguishing them significantly from the Kingdom Plantae."

      "question": "Read the following scenario and answer the questions:\n\nDriver X applies brakes suddenly upon seeing a stationary obstacle ahead. Due to the sudden application of brakes, the passengers in the bus lurch forward sharply. Furthermore, when the bus speeds up again, the bus driver observes that the necessary force required to accelerate the bus is much higher when the bus is fully loaded compared to when it is empty.",

      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "A. The passengers lurch forward due to inertia of motion (Newton's First Law). The passengers' bodies tend to remain in the state of motion (moving forward) even when the bus (the external frame) stops. B. Mass is the measure of inertia. A heavier bus (fully loaded) has greater mass, hence greater inertia. C. According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), if acceleration 'a' is kept constant, a greater mass 'm' requires a proportionally greater force 'F'. D. Momentum is the product of mass and velocity ($p=mv$).",
