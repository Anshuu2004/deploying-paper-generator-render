      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sex-linked traits are carried on the X chromosome. Males inherit the Y chromosome from their father and the X chromosome from their mother. If the trait is expressed, the X chromosome inherited from the mother must carry the recessive allele.",

      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "answer": "The pH scale is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration (H+) in a solution, ranging from 0 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly basic/alkaline). A pH of 7 is neutral. If a solution has a pH of 9, its nature is basic or alkaline, because its pH value is greater than 7.",

      "answer": "Asexual Reproduction: 1. Involves only one parent. 2. Offspring are genetically identical clones of the parent (minimal variation, except due to mutation).\nSexual Reproduction: 1. Usually involves two parents (male and female). 2. Offspring show genetic variation and are not identical to the parents, as they inherit genes from both.",

      "question": "Explain briefly why stars twinkle but planets do not, when viewed from the Earth.",
      "marks": 2,
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "answer": "Stars twinkle because they are very distant and appear almost as point sources of light. As their light enters the Earth's atmosphere, it undergoes multiple refractions due to constantly changing atmospheric conditions (temperature, density), causing the apparent position and intensity to fluctuate (twinkle).\nPlanets, being much closer, appear as extended sources (collections of point sources). The total fluctuation of light received from an extended source averages out, thus cancelling the twinkling effect.",

      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Primary Function: The ozone layer (O₃) present in the stratosphere acts as a shield, absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation coming from the sun, preventing it from reaching the Earth's surface.\nAdverse Effects of Depletion: 1. Increase in skin cancer and cataracts in humans. 2. Damage to crops and phytoplankton, affecting the marine food web and agricultural productivity.",

      "question": "Why are silver and copper not used for making fuses, even though they are excellent conductors of electricity? Which material is ideally used for fuses and why?",
      "marks": 2,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Silver and copper are excellent conductors but are not used for fuses because they have high melting points. A fuse is designed to melt and break the circuit when a large current flows. If the wire doesn't melt easily, it defeats the purpose of the safety device.\nIdeally, a fuse is made of an alloy of Lead (Pb) and Tin (Sn) because this alloy has a very low melting point. This ensures that the fuse melts quickly when the current exceeds the safe limit, protecting the circuit and appliances.",
