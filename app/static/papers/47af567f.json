Finally, it decelerates uniformly for 4 seconds to come to rest.\nQ24.1: Calculate the maximum velocity attained by the car.\nQ24.2: Calculate the distance covered during the period of constant velocity.\nQ24.3: Calculate the retardation during the final 4 seconds.",

      "answer": "Q24.1: Maximum velocity (v) is reached after 5 seconds of acceleration.\nUsing v = u + at, where u=0, a=2 m/s², t=5 s.\nv = 0 + (2 m/s² * 5 s) = 10 m/s. (1 mark)\nQ24.2: Distance covered during constant velocity (s₂).\nVelocity = 10 m/s, Time = 10 s.\n$s_2 = v \\times t = 10 \\text{ m/s} \\times 10 \\text{ s} = 100 \\text{ m}$. (2 marks)\nQ24.3: Retardation (a₃) during the final 4 seconds.\nInitial velocity (u) = 10 m/s, Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s, Time (t) = 4 s.\nUsing v = u + at:\n$0 = 10 + a_3(4)$\n$4a_3 = -10$\n$a_3 = -2.5 \\text{ m/s}^2$.

(2 marks)\nQ25.3: Chemical properties depend on the number of valence electrons, which determines bonding behavior. Since isotopes have the same number of electrons (and protons), their electron configuration is identical, resulting in identical chemical properties. Physical properties (like density, melting point, or mass) depend on the mass of the atom, which differs due to the varying number of neutrons. (2 marks)",
