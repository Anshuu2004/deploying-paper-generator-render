      "answer": "Viruses are excluded because they do not display the characteristics of life until they enter a living cell, making them borderline between living and non-living.\n1. Non-cellular Structure: Viruses lack cellular machinery (like ribosomes or cytoplasm) and are essentially nucleic acid coated by protein, hence they do not fit into any kingdom based on cell structure.\n2.

      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "Limitations:\n1. Stability of the Atom: According to classical electromagnetic theory, an electron revolving in a circular orbit should accelerate and radiate energy. This would cause the electron to spiral into the nucleus, leading to the collapse of the atom, which contradicts observations.\n2. Spectral Explanation: Rutherford’s model could not explain the characteristic line spectra observed for elements.\nBohr's Resolution: Bohr proposed that electrons revolve only in specific, fixed orbits (discrete energy levels) and that they do not radiate energy while orbiting in these fixed shells, thus ensuring atomic stability.",
