      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "Rutherford's flaw: His model predicted that electrons, revolving in circular orbits, would accelerate and, according to classical electromagnetic theory, should continuously emit energy. This energy loss would cause the electron to spiral into the nucleus, making the atom highly unstable. However, atoms are observed to be stable.\nBohr’s correction: Bohr proposed that electrons occupy specific, discrete orbits (stationary states) and, as long as they remain in these orbits, they do not radiate energy. They only absorb or emit energy when they jump between these fixed energy levels.",

According to the law:\n1. F ∝ M × m\n2.

Ammonification: Conversion of complex organic nitrogen compounds (from dead plants/animals and waste) back into ammonia by decaying bacteria and fungi.\n3. Nitrification: Conversion of ammonia into nitrites by Nitrosomonas bacteria, and then nitrites are converted into nitrates by Nitrobacter bacteria. Plants absorb nitrogen mainly in the form of nitrates.\n4. Denitrification: Conversion of nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) by denitrifying bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas), completing the cycle.\nCrucial Role of Bacteria: Bacteria are indispensable as they are the only organisms capable of performing nitrogen fixation (breaking the strong N₂ triple bond) and denitrification, thus controlling the flow of nitrogen between the atmosphere and the soil/living matter.",
