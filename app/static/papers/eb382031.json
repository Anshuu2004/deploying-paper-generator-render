      "options": [],
      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Variation is crucial because it allows species to adapt to changing environments. If a population consists only of identical individuals, and the environment changes drastically (e.g., introduction of a new disease or change in temperature), the entire population could be wiped out.\nExample: If a population of bacteria lives in warm water, and the temperature rises significantly, only those individual bacteria that have a genetic variation allowing them to tolerate higher heat will survive and reproduce. This ensures the continuation of the species, even though the majority perished.",
      "explanation": "Variations, particularly those arising from sexual reproduction or mutations, provide the raw material for natural selection, driving evolution and long-term species survival.",

      "question": "A metal 'X' is found to react vigorously with cold water, producing hydrogen gas and a solution of its hydroxide. When 'X' is heated strongly with iron oxide, the reaction is highly exothermic, producing molten iron.\n1. Identify metal 'X'.\n2. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between 'X' and iron oxide.\n3. What category of reaction is represented by the action of 'X' on iron oxide?",
      "options": [],
      "marks": 3,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "1. Identification: Metal 'X' reacts vigorously with cold water (implying high reactivity) and can displace iron from its oxide (meaning it is more reactive than iron). X is Aluminum (Al) or Potassium (K) or Sodium (Na). Given its common use in displacement reactions like the thermite reaction to produce molten iron, the most suitable answer is Aluminum (Al).\n2. Equation for reaction with Iron Oxide (Thermite Reaction, assuming X=Al):\n2Al (s) + Fe₂O₃ (s) → Al₂O₃ (s) + 2Fe (l) + Heat\n3. Category of reaction: Displacement reaction (specifically, a highly exothermic Thermite reaction).",
      "explanation": "Aluminum is highly reactive, though its reaction with cold water is slow due to the oxide layer. Its ability to reduce Fe₂O₃ exothermically (Thermite reaction) confirms it is much higher in the reactivity series than Iron, classifying the reaction as displacement.",
